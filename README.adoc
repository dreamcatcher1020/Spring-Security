== Code of Conduct
Please see our https://github.com/spring-projects/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[code of conduct]

== Downloading Artifacts
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/#getting[Getting Spring Security] for how to obtain Spring Security.

== Documentation
Be sure to read the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Security Reference].
Extensive JavaDoc for the Spring Security code is also available in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/[Spring Security API Documentation].

== Quick Start
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/#servlet-hello[Hello Spring Security] to get started with a "Hello, World" application.

== Building from Source
Spring Security uses a https://gradle.org[Gradle]-based build system.
In the instructions below, https://vimeo.com/34436402[`./gradlew`] is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as
a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build.

=== Prerequisites
https://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect[Git] and the https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads[JDK17 build].

Be sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the `jdk-17` folder extracted from the JDK download.

=== Check out sources
[indent=0]
----
git clone git@github.com:spring-projects/spring-security.git
----

=== Install all spring-\* jars into your local Maven cache
[indent=0]
----
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

=== Compile and test; build all jars, distribution zips, and docs
[indent=0]
----
./gradlew build
----

The reference docs are not currently included in the distribution zip.
You can build the reference docs for this branch by running the following command:

----
./gradlew :spring-security-docs:antora
----

That command publishes the docs site to the _docs/build/site_ directory.
The https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/docs-build[playbook branch] describes how to build the reference docs in detail.

Discover more commands with `./gradlew tasks`.
